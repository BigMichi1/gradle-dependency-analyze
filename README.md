# gradle-dependency-anayze
Dependency analysis plugin for gradle

This was originally forked from https://gist.github.com/kellyrob99/4334483

This plugin attempts to replicate the functionality of the maven dependency plugin's analyze goals which fail the build if dependencies are declared but not used or used but not declared.
